// generate the following:
// 1. For each channel, craete an array that contains:
// * only shows which have more then 20% prime watching
// * have only the show name and channel and day in that array
// * merge the two arrays into one


// 2. use the new array and create another array which holds the following:
// * only the best show for each day between the two channels


// 3. Calculate which channel had more shows in the array from step 2
